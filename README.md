# hello-world
My First Coding ever in Github. So, hello world..
I am an aspiring CS Engineer and a student at Chitkara University, completed my BCA in 2022 and currently studying MCA and this is my first ever code here.
It would be very generous of you to guide me into this coding world.
I would like to develop more professional skills and learn more about this technological world.
I love to learn whether it is hardware related, software related or even if it is from some other major, I love to learn.
